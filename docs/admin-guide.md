# Website admin guide

For the staff who update the website. The admin area is in English; everything visitors see is in Tamil.
The same steps are also inside the admin area: press **Help** in the left menu.

## Log in
1. Open your website address followed by `/admin` (for example `https://yourwebsite.org/admin`).
2. Type the username and password you were given, then press **Log in**. The eye button shows the password while you type it.
3. When you finish, press **Log out** at the bottom of the menu, especially on a shared computer.

Forgot the password? Ask the developer. They can set a new one in a minute.

## Finding your way around
- **On a computer** the menu is on the left. **On a phone** press the ☰ button at the top left to open it.
- The gold **New post** button is always there.
- **Home** shows a short summary: how many posts you have, what is still missing on the website (banner photo, bank details, contact details…), and your latest posts.
- Menu groups: **Content** (Posts, Committee) and **Website pages** (Home page, Donation, Contact and links, Radio).

## Add news (New post)
It works like a Facebook post.
1. Press **New post**.
2. Choose which **section** the news is for. The sections are shown by their Tamil names: அன்பின்பாதை – சமூகப் பணிகள், பசுமைத் தாயகம், கலை & இலக்கியம், எண்ணம்போல் வாழ்க்கை மாணவர் மன்றம், “சிறுகதை மஞ்சரி” அனைத்துலக வாசகர் வட்டம், வாசிப்போம் சுவாசிப்போம்.
3. Write the news in the big box, in Tamil. The first line becomes the title, so make it short and clear.
4. Under **Add to your post** you can add:
   - **Photos**: pick as many as you like (up to 20). Use the arrows to change the order. The first photo is the cover picture.
   - **YouTube video**: paste the link of the video.
   - **Facebook link**: paste the link of a public Facebook post or video, and it shows inside the post.
   - **Date**: only needed to give an older date to an old post.
5. Press **Post** to publish at once, or **Save as draft** to keep it hidden for now.

The post appears on the website within a few seconds. A small note in the bar at the bottom says "You have unsaved changes" until you save.

**Messages:** when something is saved, published, deleted or goes wrong, a small notice (a "toast") appears in the top-right corner of the screen (top of the screen on a phone) and disappears by itself after a few seconds. Errors stay a little longer. Press the × to close one, or hold the mouse over it to keep it open. If you try to leave a page through the menu with unsaved changes, a window asks "Leave without saving?". Closing or refreshing the browser tab with unsaved changes shows the browser's own standard warning, which websites cannot restyle.

## Change or remove a post (Posts)
- Use the tabs **All / Published / Drafts** and the section buttons to find a post.
- **Edit**: change the text, photos or links, then press **Save changes**.
- **Unpublish**: hides the post from visitors but keeps it. **Publish** shows it again.
- **View on website** opens the published post.
- The red bin deletes the post and its photos for good. A window asks you to confirm first.

## Committee members (Committee)
- The page has these groups, in this order: Director, President, Secretary and Treasurer (shown together as நிர்வாகத் தலைமை), **Committee members** (நிர்வாகசபை உறுப்பினர்கள்), **Patrons** (போசகர்கள்), and **Members** (உறுப்பினர்கள், the ordinary members, always last). A group with nobody in it stays hidden on the website.
- **Add member**: type the name in Tamil (with திரு, திருமதி, செல்வி), choose the group, add a photo. Use the **Add member** button inside a group to start with that group chosen.
- **Edit**: change details or the photo. The role title is filled in from the group if you leave it empty.
- Use the **← →** buttons on a card to move a person earlier or later inside their group.
- The red bin removes a member (you are asked to confirm).

## Website pages
Each page has its own **Save changes** button and saves only its own details, so nothing else is affected.
- **Home page**: the banner photo, tagline, headline and welcome words.
  - The banner works best as a wide landscape photo. Words are written over it in white, so avoid very bright photos.
  - If you press **Remove image** by mistake, press **Undo**. The photo is only deleted when you press **Save changes**.
- **Donation**: bank details shown on the Donation page. The account name and number get "copy" buttons for donors.
- **Contact and links**: phone, email, address, and the Facebook and YouTube links. They appear on the Contact page and in the footer of every page.
- **Radio**: puts the Pothigai Internet Radio player on the website (see below).

## Radio (Pothigai Internet Radio)
The radio itself runs on its own small server (AzuraCast). The website only needs its listening address.
1. Open **Radio** under Website pages.
2. In AzuraCast, open your station and copy the **Stream URL** (the listening address, often ending in `.mp3`). It must start with `https://`.
3. Paste it into **Stream address** and press **Save changes**.
4. Optional: paste the **Song name address** (in AzuraCast it looks like `https://your-radio-site/api/nowplaying/your-station`) to show the song that is playing.

Once a stream address is saved, the radio appears in four places: a band on the Home page, its own **Radio** page, a round radio button next to Donate in the top bar (in the phone menu on phones), and a link in the footer. When a visitor presses play, a small player stays at the bottom of the screen and keeps playing while they open other pages. They stop it with the stop button.

- Visitors can share the radio with anyone: right under the player on the Radio page there is a share row (**Facebook**, **WhatsApp**, **Copy link**). It shares the name of the radio and the address of the Radio page.
- To hide the radio for a while (for example, while the radio server is being fixed), switch off **Show the radio on the website** and save. The addresses are kept.
- If the address is empty or does not start with `https://`, the radio is not shown.
- If the radio server is down, visitors see a friendly message and a "try again" button.

## Radio schedule (programme times)
Shows visitors when your radio programmes are on, in a list on the Radio page, right under the player and above **நீங்கள் கேட்கலாம்**.
1. Open **Radio schedule** under Website pages (there is also a link on the Radio settings page).
2. Press **Add programme**.
3. Choose **On one date** (a single programme) or **Every week** (it repeats on the same day each week).
4. Pick the date, or the day of the week, then the **start time** and, if you like, the **end time**.
5. Type the **programme heading** in Tamil. The box on the right, **How visitors will see it**, shows the exact wording, so you can check it before you save.
6. Press **Add programme**. It appears on the Radio page at once.

- Times are Sri Lanka time. The page tells visitors so.
- Programmes are listed with the soonest first, and the nearest one is marked **அடுத்தது** (next).
- A programme with a single date disappears from the website by itself once it is over (if you gave no end time, about two hours after it starts). It stays in the admin under **Past programmes**, so you can delete it or copy its wording. Weekly programmes stay until you delete them.
- To change a programme press **Edit**. To remove one press the red bin. You are asked to confirm first.
- If the radio is switched off (or has no stream address), the whole Radio page is hidden, so the schedule is hidden too. The admin page reminds you of this.
- The Radio page refreshes itself every few minutes, so a finished programme can stay for a few minutes after its time.

## Adjust a photo (move, zoom, rotate)
- Next to the home banner and each committee photo there is an **Adjust** button. In a news post, each photo has a small crop button.
- In the window that opens: **drag** the photo to move it, use the **slider** (or the + and - buttons, or two fingers) to **zoom**, and press **Rotate left / Rotate right** if it came out sideways.
- Press **Use this photo** to keep your changes, or **Cancel** to leave the photo as it was.
- When you choose a *new* banner or committee photo, this window opens by itself, so you can place the photo before it is saved.
- **Banner:** the dashed lines show the middle part that is always visible on a phone. Keep the main subject between them.
- **Committee photos:** the round frame shows how the photo will look on the website. Put the face in the middle.
- Adjusting a photo that is already saved works on the saved picture. To show a part of the original photo that was already cut away, choose the original photo again with **Change image**.

## Photo tips
- Any photo from a phone is fine. It is made smaller automatically before it is saved.
- Use JPG, PNG or WebP photos.

## If something looks wrong
- Refresh the page once.
- Log out and log in again.
- Tell the developer what you were doing and what you saw. The database is backed up every week.
